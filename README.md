# Machaine-Learning-Big-Data

Cleaning Data and removing outlires are essential in any Big Data project. 
The results of the any project are more efficient if you prepare your Data.
Decision making must be built on Data with high quilaty. 
In this folder I am using three ways to remove the outliers:
1-Outlier detection and removal of the outlier by Using IQR The Data points consider outliers if it's below the first quartile or above the third quartile
2-Remove the Outliers by using the percentile
3-Remove the outliers by using zscore and standard deviation
